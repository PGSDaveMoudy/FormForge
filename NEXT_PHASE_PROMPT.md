## ðŸ›  Development Guidelines

**Architecture Principles:**
- Follow existing monorepo structure strictly
- Keep files under 300 lines - break into modules
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow RESTful API design patterns

**Security Requirements:**
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- XSS protection and content sanitization
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Secure file upload handling
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

**Performance Requirements:**
- Form builder should handle 100+ elements smoothly
- API responses under 200ms for CRUD operations
- Frontend bundle size under 1MB (excluding vendor)
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Implement caching where appropriate

## ðŸ“‹ Development Approach

**Start with these exact steps:**

1. **Assessment & Planning:**
   - Examine the current codebase structure
   - Review the existing backend API and database setup
   - Plan the database schema updates needed
   - Create a development roadmap

2. **Backend Foundation:**
   - Implement Prisma schema and run migrations
   - Build authentication system with JWT
   - Create user registration and login endpoints
   - Set up email verification workflow

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Replace static HTML with React application
   - Set up routing and state management
   - Implement authentication UI
   - Create basic dashboard structure

4. **Form Builder Core:**
   - Build drag-and-drop canvas
   - Implement basic form elements
   - Create properties panel
   - Add form save/load functionality

5. **API Integration:**
   - Connect frontend to backend APIs
   - Implement form CRUD operations
   - Add real-time form preview
   - Test end-to-end workflows

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

**Phase 2 Complete When:**
- Users can register, login, and manage accounts

**Begin by examining the current codebase, then systematically build out the authentication system, followed by the React frontend, and finally the drag-and-drop form builder. Focus on getting a working MVP first, then enhance with advanced features.**

**Your goal: Transform FormForge from a infrastructure foundation into a fully functional, production-ready form builder application.**
